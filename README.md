## SLUGScan

An RFID based register system.

# Functionality

- Read a scanned card's ID.
- Check if the card is assigned to a member.
- If not, prompt to register the card to a member - this allows new members to easily register at an event.
- Otherwise, set the member as signing into or out of an event, which is defined as a parameter on starting the program.
